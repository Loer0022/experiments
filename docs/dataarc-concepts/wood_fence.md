## Wood Fence 

###  Scope note: 
A “wood fence” is a structure found typically outdoors that can be used to mark the extent of a field, mark ownership or to enclose areas. This can come in many shapes and forms depending on regional differences and availability of material, furthermore differences in time also determines the shape of the fence and materials used.

### Examples: 

* Modern cityscapes are often defined by chain-link fencing used in all areas from delimiting parks to enclosing certain spaces from the public. However, many row houses in urban areas and suburban houses still use wooden fencing to enclose their property.
* Roundpole fences are known as gärdsgård in Scandinavia, were constructed using young trees and branches as poles and binding cords. These was commonly used in Scandinavia to mark field boundaries.
* Wattle fences are made from weaving thin branches between upright stakes to form a robust structure. This kind of fencing can if weaved more tightly between the branches form the basis for wattle and daub walls.
